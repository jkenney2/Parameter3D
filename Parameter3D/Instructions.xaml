                    Parameter3D is a program which allows the user to create and manipulate 3-dimensional objects using pre-defined primitive shapes, supplied or user-created templates, or user-supplied parameteric equations.

                    Creating Objects
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph FontSize="14">
                    The simplest method of creating a 3D object is to select the desired color in the "Color Selection Box", 
                    then select a primitive shape (for example, a sphere or a cube) from the "Shapes Toolbar".  
                    This creates an object with no required input of equations or numeric parameters.  The "Shapes Menu" is 
                    an alternative to the Shapes Toolbar.  It includes all of the shapes included in the shapes toolbar, and 
                    numerous additional shapes.  The Shapes Toolbar
                    and Shapes Menu make use of Parameter 3D Data Files (.p3d).  As discussed below, these files can also be
                    created by the user to save objects for later use.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph FontSize="14">
                    The second-simplest method of creating an object is with the "Templates Menu".  Selecting an item from the
                    templates menu opens a dialog which requires user input of parameters to determine dimensions and other features
                    of the created object.  For example, the template for a sphere requires input of the desired radius, while the
                    template for a block requires the lengths of the three sides.  The template dialog also requires that the color
                    be selected.  The Templates Menu provides access to templates than are included as part of the Parameter 3D
                    installation.  Templates (.p3t files) can also be created by the user.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph FontSize="14">
                    Finally, a 3D object can be created by entering a set of parametric equations that define a surface in three 
                    dimensions.
                    <Italic>( Not interested in entering equations?  Then skip to the "Selecting Objects" section below. )</Italic> Such a set of equations must provide a definition of the points (x,y,z) along the surface as a
                    function of two parameters, named "s" and "t".  For standard parametric equations the user defines three functions:  x(s,t),
                    y(s,t), and z(s,t).  A slightly more complex approach is also supported:  extrusion equations.
                    For extrusion equations, the user defines three functions which describe the centerline of the extrusion  
                    {x(s), y(s), z(s)} as well as two functions which define the cross-sectional shape of the extrusion as a given value
                    of s {x'(s,t), y'(s,t)}.  The equations and supporting data are entered into the control panel at the left of the 
                    screen.  In addition to equations, the beginning and ending values for s and t must be entered (Smin, Smax, Tmin, 
                    Tmax).  The Number of facets (Grid Size) in the s and t dimensions must also be entered, and a color must be selected.  
                    Pressing the "Add Object" button generates the new object.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph FontSize="14">
                    Note that the 3D surfaces are formed of multiple triangles, and that each surface has a "front" and a "back" side.
                    The front of the surface bears the color selected when the surface is created.  The back is gray in color by 
                    default, but this can be changed, as described in detail below.  The front side is determined using the 
                    "right hand rule".  For those interested, it works as follows.  Place the pinky side of the partly closed 
                    hand along points at (s,t), (s+ds,t), (s+ds,t+dt).  The extended thumb will indicate the front side.  If the
                    front and back sides of a surface are the reverse of desired, switching the values of TMin and TMax will 
                    be corrective.

                <Paragraph FontSize="16" FontWeight="Bold">Selecting Objects</Paragraph>
                <Paragraph FontSize="14">
                    When an object is first created, it automatically becomes the "selected object".  To select a different object,
                    double-click on the desired object with the left mouse button.  In addition to maintaining a selected object, 
                    Parameter 3D also maintains a "selected list" of objects.  The selected object is always the first element of the 
                    selected list.  When a new object is selected as the selected object, the list is cleared (except for the new 
                    selected object).  To add an object to the selected list, double-click over the object with the Ctrl button 
                    pressed.  The selected object is the target of many of the manipulations and operations described in the following 
                    paragraphs.  The selected list is used only for combining multiple objects into a single object.  This 
                    operation is described below.  The "Highlight" group box is provided in the control panel (left side of the 
                    user interface) to help keep track of which object is the selected object, and which objects are
                    included in the selected list.  Clicking the "Selection" radio button in this group box causes the selected object 
                    to be "highlighted"--that is, it temporarily becomes bright white in color.  Clicking the "List" radio button 
                    causes all objects in the selected list to be highlighted.  Clicking the "None" radio button turns off all 
                    highlighting.
